      <p> Ted Lasso is an American production televison series that fits the genre of a sport comedy-drama series. The
        show is developed by
        Jason Sudeikis, Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly. Sudeikis (Ted), was first used for NBC Sport's
        promotional coverage on the
        english premier league in which Ted Lasso was portrayed as a funny attempt to mock an american coaching an
        english team. This skit did
        very well, in which the hit televison series Ted Lasso was formally created. You can vist this skit <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeG_i8CWE8"> HERE </a> for reference. The show follows Ted Lasso,
        an American football coach who is hired to take over the premier league team, AFC Richmond. However, the owner
        of the club, Rebbeca, had the intention to sabotage the club
        due to her cheating husbands love for the club.<br> <br> Foolishly, Ted Lasso was able to combine his passion
        and leadership skills to outweigh his knowledge
        of english football to prove himself a sustainable manager. Ted Lasso also uses real-life events and
        personalities to tailor the show to make it more
        authentic and appeal to the football audience. I will address the characters and personalities they are being
        portrayed in the team section of my website.
        Regarding this, the series has received critical acclaim and praised for certain aspects that the show covers,
        from football antics, to mental health and relationship
        issues, relating to everyday people to make footballers feel more human then just football stars.
